KenoProject Overview
========================================================================

1.  Assignment CMPS 5243 Algorithm Analysis:
 
  The casino game 'KENO' involves the selection of 20 balls from 80 balls numbered 
  1 ... 80. The player selects k numbers (1-20).  The payoff depends on how many 
  of the player's numbers that the casino machine selects.  For example, if the 
  player selects 9 numbers and 5 of them are generated by the machine, he/she wins 
  $4.00; if 6 are generated, the player wins $43.00.

  This program is to determine the probability of each possible situation and place 
  these probabilites in a 20 x 21 array of real values.  The entries in the [ith] 
  row assume that the player has selected i numbers.  The entry in the [jth] column 
  is the probability that the player catches j spots out of i possible.  Of course, 
  if j > i, the probability is 0.0.  In general, if i <= j, the probability is given 
  by:

```<language>
      P (catch j out of i numbers) = C ( i, j ) * P1 * P2 / P3, where
      C (i, j) = i! / ((i-j)! * j!)

      P1 ( factors ) = 20 * 19 * 18 ... factors, where factors = j
      P2 ( factors ) = 60 * 59 * 58 ... factors, where factors = i - j
      P3 ( factors ) = 80 * 79 * 78 ... factors, where factors = i
```

  Together with this program specification there is a sheet of payoffs for between 1 & 9
  spots marked.  Calculate for each number of spots marked the "expected value" of a $1
  bet.

  Implementation
===============================================================================

* The program used combinatorics to calculate the payout probabilities.
  - See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination

* It further used COM Automation to create an MS Excel Spreadsheet (from within a Native C++
  Console Application) as the final output file for the the calculated probability data.
